          <h2>We understand that chaos dungeons and Guardian raids are important but how do they work?</h2>

        <section class="row">
          <p class="column">
            Now we can go more in depth about Chaos dungeons and Guardian raids. Chaos dungeons are daily instance based dungeons which take about 3-5 minutes to complete they
            are the main source of Guardian/Destruction stones, silver and <b>honing shards</b>. With honing shards being the most important as honing 
            shards have very few sources. Chaos dungeons also have an item level requirement basically this is a way to lock out players form doing higher tier 
            chaos dungeons since those give even more rewards you get more rewards as you get a high Ilvl due to the cost of honing going up as well. In the GIF to 
            the right we can see a player scrolling through the different chaos dungeons showing the requirements to enter each. The top right of the UI showing us the Ilevel
            required to enter the next gate and the middle of the screen showing us the quest prerequisets inorder to enter this dungeon. Typically Dungeons are sectioned off into 
            different continents meaning if you completed some contentent then you have accsess to all of its chaos dungeons in the Gif were being shown all of the 
            Punika chaos dungeons. Finallly we have the right side which simply shows us the materials that can drop from the selected gate with the rarity of the items going 
            up as the person progresses to high chaos dungeons. Guardian raids work very similarly with the same prerequisets except instead of mainly dropping shards it mainly drops leapstones 
            which is typically the second bottleneck when honing. Another difference of Guardian raids is instead of killing weaker monsters there is only one boss monster to kill.
