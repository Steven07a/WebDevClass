            Now that we know how to raise our Item level and boost our general
            power we can do the endgame content which is raids. Here ill be
            showing one mechanic of a multi part raid. Raids can range from 4-8
            people instances where there is a singular boss similar to Guardian
            raids the main difference being that there are typically wipe
            mechanics. This raid specifically is a 8 man raid.

          <h2>120 HP bars</h2>
          <p>
            Once Vykas hits 120 hp bars shes going to go into her first mechanic
            which is the color wing test. What will happen is vykas will become
            immune and untargetable. 3 Vykas silhouette will spawn at 2, 7, and
            11 o clock. Each silhouette will raise a number of wings ranging
            from 0-2 and the people at the clock positions would need to call
            out the number of wings and there clock positions. Meanwhile the
            other 5 players will need to start picking up orbs arranged in a
            cross shape starting from the center of the map. After each player
            picks up there orb a buff will appear above there head either with a
            purple or red symbol. These players need to run to the center of the
            map and figure out which color is the majority as that determins
            which order is safe. If the majority is
            <b style="color: red">red</b> then the order is 2 > 1 > 0 and if its
            <b style="color: rgb(221, 18, 221)">purple</b> then its the opposite
            0 > 1 > 2. If you survived then you've passed the first mechanic.

          <h2>65 HP bars</h2>
          <p>
            The second mechanic starts at 65 hp bars and again Vykas will become
            invincible and disapear then her black silhouettes will appear but
            this time they will be located around 12,5, and 7 o clock. 2 players
            should be assigned to each position with the remaining 2 players
            standing in the center reading the chat. The reason for this is
            because the silhouettes will pulse a total of 5 times with the color
            being either black or red. Atleast one of the players will need to
            keep track of the sequence of pulses typically by typing the
            sequence into chat. ex: 12 brbrb
            <br />Afterwards the 2 players standing in the middle need to run to
            the sequences with 3 black orbs in them while only taking the last
            black orb in the sequence. if a different orb is taken that person
            will die and if a black orb does not get blocked then the whole
            party will die. Once this mechanic is complete then its mostly a
            damage check.
