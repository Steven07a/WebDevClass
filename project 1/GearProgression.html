            Now that we've finished the story its time to play the endgame
            content. This includes Chaos dungeons, Guardian Raids, Abyssal
            dungeons, Una's Task and more. First ill go over the general power
            progression which is honing. Regualr materials for honing include
            silver, the corresponding shards and fragments as well as
            leapstones. Basically regular materials is the bare minumum needed
            to hone and increase the players power. Then why do we need
            additional material? Well this is because like many MMO's it gets
            much harder to increase power the higher you get. To give some
            context in the begining stages of honing for
            <!-- Strikethrough tag or s tag being used here to signify that this information is no longer relavent.

            <s>
              T1 and T2 the honing percentages range from 80-60% with each
              succsessful hone becoming harder and harder
            </s>
            <strong>
              (This has changed due to a recent patch. The honing rates for the
              first 2 tiers is now 100% as the developers want you to reach T3
              as thats where the bulk of content is.)
            </strong>
            but with the use of <mark>additional materials</mark> its possible
            to increase these honing chances by around 1-10% depending on the
            tier and level of the item you are honing. Overall additional
            materials is something you will use in the later stages of a tier as
            increasing a 90% to 100% chance to hit a hone does not feel as
            significant to boosting a 1% to 2%.
